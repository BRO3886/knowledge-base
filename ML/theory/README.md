# ML Theory

## What is Machine Learning?
A computer program is said to *learn* from experience E w.r.t some task T and some performance measure P, if it's performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Types of Learning Algorithms
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, we are providing the computer with a set of "right" answers for each input value. This is called the training data. The job of the computer is to then *learn* from these values and _guess_ another "right" answer which wasn't provided.

Supervised learning problems are of two types:
1. Regression Problems
3. Classification Problems

#### Regression

**In the above example, we are trying to predict a continuous value attribute (cost).**


#### Classification

**In the above example, we are trying to predict a discrete value attribute (malignant/not-malignant).**
